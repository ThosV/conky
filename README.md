# conky
Conky sidebar for keeping an eye on system behavior. 

Download the conkyrc file and move it into ~/.config/conky/conkyrc
The sidebar can be activated with 'conky -c ~/.config/conky/conkyrc

To change the header (which now just says USR NAME) alter line 23 of the conkyrc file. 

If you have the Conky Manager GUI it should appear as an option automatically.
